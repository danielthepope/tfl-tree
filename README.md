## Requirements
On your Raspberry Pi, you need to install some dependencies:
- `espeak` for speech synthesis
- `mediainfo` for getting information about generated speech

```bash
sudo apt install espeak mediainfo
```

`ffmpeg` should already be installed. This is required to package the video with the generated audio
